Bugs/Things to Improve:
    1. Planning on creating an object so that I don't need so many variables for each task. Will make it more compartmentalized. Hopefully also decreases runtime since already with only 1000 trials, this program takes around 1 second.
    2. Add user interface so that user can add their own network, not just the one listed on the planning project listed above.
    3. Try DiGraph Implementation. Think it might be better and work faster as well.
