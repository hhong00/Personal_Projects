Known Bugs:
1. Currently does not account for absolute difference being same when deciding which player to start first.
2. needs two players. Want to try to make computer generated response.
3. Does not account for players erroneous input.
4. Does not track which spots have been taken
5. not really a bug, but the checking board function is way too brute force. I am going to try to simplify that one.
6. Need to make it so that game can be reset and played more than once.
